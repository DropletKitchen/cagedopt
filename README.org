** Introduction
This project shows one way to package caged optics into systems with a
small footprint and highly functional design. The example here is a
simple microscope-setup for microfluidics experimentation.  Instead of
using an optics table, or an all-metal optics breadboard, a
combination of laser-cut 5mm acrylic sheets with M6 nuts and bolts are
used to assemble rigid and customized optical instruments. The system
uses a simple, magnetic kinematic design for the x,y,z-stage and a
high-power LED with cheap plastic focusing optics for illumination.
The optics is based on an infinity-corrected objective, a lens and a
global-shutter CCD or CMOS-camera to obtain videos or images. The
output of an infinity-corrected objective (they usually have an
'infinity' symbol engraved) is a parallel beam of light. It therefore
needs a lens to create an image. The advantage is that between the
objective and the lens many optic components can be placed; the design
can therefore also be used as a starting point for more complex
setups, e.g.  for measuring fluorescence. To get an idea which optics
components are available and how much they cost, have a look at the
websites of optics companies, for example Thorlabs
(https://www.thorlabs.com/navigation.cfm).

** Design
The model ([[./files/RigCageOpticsOpenSCAD.scad]]) was first developed in
openSCAD (http://www.openscad.org/) and sliced for lasercutting. Later
modifications were done in a .dxf-file with Draftsight
(http://www.3ds.com/products-services/draftsight-cad-software/free-download/). Starting
with a 3D-model is convenient to play with overall dimensions and
shapes, but the design is quicker to modify in 2D-CAD at later stages
([[./files/RigCageOpticsPartsForCutting.dxf]]). The standard fixtures for
optics on optics tables are M6, spaced 25mm apart. To have a flexible
way of mounting (additional) parts, holes of 6mm in diameter with a
spacing of 12.5mm (center to center) are additionally embedded into
the design where possible. This makes setups adaptable and extendable.

** Assembly
*** Optics
One has an overwhelming choice of optics components. Think of which
magnification you need for the objective. To focus the image onto the
camera we use a F=50mm double achromat lens, but a simple F=100mm lens

works equally well (but needs more space). As the rig uses standard 1"
optics, any camera can be mounted with appropriate adapters. We have
chosen the FireflyMV because it uses USB 2.0, has a global shutter and
can be triggered, its image binned, etc. (Firefly MV Technical
Reference Manual, https://www.ptgrey.com/support/downloads/10116). It
runs well on Ubuntu Linux (and Win) and even on Raspberry Pi. Such
'inexpensive' scientific cameras will never give you high-speed video
(max ~ 400fps with the FireflyMV when binning to a very small image),
but bright illumination and minimising the exposure time yields sharp
images of fast events, which is good enough for most microfluidics
applications. One can enhance the camera greatly by strobing the LED
light source (see here for an example:
https://github.com/DropletKitchen/strobe).  If you need high-speed
video, you will have to use a true 'fast camera' with on-board RAM,
which start around 6k GBP (eg a Miro Phantom).

For assembly you have to first attach the lens to the camera such that
it is focused to 'infinity'. Get the camera to run on a computer,
connect the camera and lens with a tube (the distance between lens
camera-chip should equal the focal length of the lens; you will need
an adjustable SM1 lens tube in your assembly to get it right). Then
focus the image on a distant object (e.g. a tree/house outside
somewhere, or a feature in a far-away corner of the lab). Fix the
distance with a locking ring. Now connect this assembly with the 30 mm
cage containing a Penta Prism or a 45 degree mirror, screw in your
objective (with the right adapter) and you are done.

*** Structure
Assembling the rig itself is pretty straightforward; have a look at
the image above. Make sure that your components fit - if you change
the design, just measure components with a caliper and use exactly
those dimensions for holes etc. Laser cut components usually result in
a tight fit. The optics assembly is held in place by clamping it
between the bottom plate and the upper part using M6 threaded rod
posts. Use washers, or better 'shake-proof washers' where possible.

The x,y,z-stage is mounted on three optics screws with spherical ends
in a kinematic fashion - this defines the position of the stage by
resting on 6 points of contact. This is ideally 3 points on one, 2 on
the next, and one on the third. Here strong magnets are used to fix
the stage on its support - a ring magnet on the first side (a small
cheat but works well), 2 stacked disk magnets that magnetize two small
steel rods on top, and a stack of three disk magnets on the third
point.  This assembly alone allows you not only to control z distance
(focus), but you can tilt and therefore have some movement in x,y. For
convenience, adding an inexpensive x,y stage is recommended. They all
differ, so make sure you adapt the files accordingly.

*** Light
For the lightsource, a star-shaped white high power LED is used which
is controlled by an adjustable LED driver (Recom RCD-24-0.70,
http://www.recom-power.com/pdf/Lightline/RCD-24.pdf). An M3 screw acts
as a heat sink and also holds the LED in place. A potentiometer is
used to control brightness. Along with an on/off switch, the
components are soldered onto a stripboard and then packaged in an
acrylic enclosure. It does not have to bear large loads, so the
enclosure is based on cut acrylic sheets with double-sided tape added
to one side before cutting. This allows the structural components to
be bonded together.  Inexpensive plastic lenses are used to focus the
LED light onto the chip. For assembly, just use a dab of epoxy
glue. Do not use 'Superglue', as the cyanoacrylate vapours cloud the
optics components over time.  Change the distance between LED and the
stage such that the image on the camera is overexposed when the LED is
fully on and the camera is set to the smallest exposure time
possible. This allows you to get the best possible images of
fast-moving objects with your setup. Below is the circuit diagram for
wiring if you use the Recom LED-driver. If you want an on/off switch,
just wire it to the voltage or ground wire. Almost any power supply
will do (>=1A, 5-36V).

** Adapt the design to other components
It is relatively easy to adjust designs to other components. Use a
caliper to measure parts and change design files accordingly.
